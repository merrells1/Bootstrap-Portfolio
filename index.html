                        <p>As cliche as it may sound, I have been an avid learner and technology-lover since a young age.  This love for learning has served me well, and it has also driven me onward in my quest to become proficient at web-development.</p>  
                        <p>I discovered my love for technology, when I was introduced to the TRS-80 computer at around 4 or 5 years old.  I was fascinated at the text on the screen and the colors that the computer could display.  A few years later, I began using the computer to create school papers and reports.  I was fascinated that a computer using software could help me not have to hand-write my papers!  When I was able to get into the DOS Shell in later computers my family owned, I began learning and using commands in order for me to navigate the software on the computer.  I loved teaching myself how to change directories, make new directories and start computer games, all using commands.  I then progressed naturally into "windows" operating systems and more powerful computers.  I began using CAD software systems to draw rudimentary home plans in junior high school, and I was hooked on designing houses in early high school.</p>
                        <p>I received CAD drafting certifications from a trade school and began working in the house plan design industry in 1998 or 1999.  Since that time, I have worked for a Utah home-builder as well as a Utah architectural and engineering firm.  Despite loving to design homes and design other buildings, my interest in coding has not ceased since my first foray into the DOS operating system.</p>
                        <p>My love for coding and software has driven me to pivot away from the architecture industry and into the web development industry. It is so fascinating and rewarding to be able to use HTML, CSS and Java to create vivid and functional websites.  There is always something to learn and to try out in creating the web pages and it is exciting and rewarding to do it!</p>
                        <p>Besides the fact that I am so interested in coding and design, I also am an avid hiker, I love to bike-ride, I love music and I love art.  I have a wonderful wife and step-daughter, who are the light of my life, and who I love to watch movies with or go to Crystal Hot Springs with.</p>
